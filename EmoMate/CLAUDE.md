## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Expo SDK 53** with React Native 0.79.5 and React 19.0.0
- **TypeScript** in strict mode for type safety
- **Zustand + Immer** for state management with immutable updates
- **React Navigation v7** for stack-based navigation
- **Expo Camera & Audio** for video/audio functionality

### State Management Pattern
The app uses Zustand with Immer middleware for clean, immutable state updates:
- `src/store/userStore.ts` - Central user state including AI character selection and emotion logs
- State is organized with typed interfaces and action creators
- Immer enables clean mutations that are safely immutable

### Permission Management
The app implements a permission-first design:
- Camera and microphone permissions are requested on app launch
- `src/utils/permissions.ts` provides centralized permission utilities
- UI gracefully handles permission denied states with user guidance

### Navigation Structure
- Stack navigator with TypeScript-typed route parameters
- Initial flow: WelcomeScreen → HomeScreen
- Navigation types defined in `App.tsx` and imported across screens

## Key Files and Patterns
